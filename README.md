### Hello there :suspect:, I am Paul Artushkov (also known as pavTiger)

Since the early childhood, I've been interested in technology. I started with soldering some boards and Arduino components. 
Then I slowly switched to Robotics olympiads with LEGO EV3 system. And went to RRO (Russian Robot Olympiad) in <b>Innopolis</b>. 
As I went to the fifth grade, I switched to more practical programming (that was the time when I started using <b>GitHub</b>). And currently, I am an Olympiad coder.

I study in an IT & Physics school Silaeder, where we do many projects.

My biggest projects are:
* Physarum modeling
* TRON Legacy game
* And many more hackathons

Recently I went to an Internship to a company named Visyond.
They are doing an excel for business people. It was a great experience☺️
