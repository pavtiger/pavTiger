## Hello there :suspect:, I am Paul Artushkov (also known as pavTiger)
Since early childhood, I've been interested in technology. I started with soldering some boards and Arduino components. 
Then I slowly switched to Robotics olympiads with LEGO EV3 system. And went to RRO (Russian Robot Olympiad) in **Innopolis**. 
As I went to the fifth grade, I switched to more practical programming (that was the time when I started using **GitHub**). 
Enjoy hackathons very much and have been to many of **CROC** hacks (and won a few). Recently, I started coding Olympiad tasks in **Tinkoff Generation**.

I study in an IT & Physics school named Silaeder, where we do many projects and hackathons.

Languages I know well: Python, C++, Javascript, Pascal, C.  
I have a lot of experience with Linux and bash scripting. 
Having tried a big variety of graphic libraries and frameworks, I've found Three.js, which is used in many of my projects. Having some experience with [animation & 3D modeling](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcn5eK1LvnGsmkTJKvAw54Up8n7LRRUP_) as well. A favourite model of mine: [TRON lightcycle](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tron-legacy-encom-786-lightcycle-89c2eba426574f53aaa9a8ee37c60495)

English level B2 proven by Cambridge exam PET (Currently my level is ~C1, but I didn't take the exam yet). Once went to an English camp to Hastings, England to improve my Enlish level.

## My biggest projects are:
* [Physarum modeling](https://github.com/physarumAdv)
* [TRON Legacy game](https://github.com/light-merch/TRON_multiplayer)
* [Moscow Metro analytics](https://github.com/pavtiger/Moscow-Underground-Analysus)
* [Jedi interceptor Star Wars animation](https://youtu.be/P4HUq_jLq50)
* Chatbots
* And many more hackathons

Just before COVID-19 (**2020**), I went to Saint Petersburg to participate in [Balt Konkurs](https://baltkonkurs.ru). Won 3rd-degree award and Youth jury laureate prize in "Computer Science'. In **2021** I also passed to Balt Konkurs, but due to COVID couldn't attend it. And in **2022** I was just preparing to go to Saint Petersburg, but the conference got postphoned to march, really hope that COVID situation's gonna improve...  
And recently I went on an Internship at a company named Visyond.
They are creating an Excel for business people. It was a great experienceâ˜º  
Now I'm at an internship in a company [Renaissance Capital](https://www.rencap.com), there I work with Power BI, especially Power Query which is an Excel add-on that is a tool to manage your data.

## My favorite hackathons:
* [MediaHack](http://mediahack.me) - May 2019. We won the nomination of **"Hellish coders"**. Because we wrote a lot of code, had a great architecture and the way we were coding with a huge flipchart on a wall, being very load at discussing something, etc
* [CraftHack](https://crafthack.me) - August 2019. Had a fun time soldering Arduinos and trying to make a game in terminal
* [WildHack](https://wildhack.croc.ru) - December 2021. Got together with some friends and wrote a Neural Network recognising fish in photos from a reserve park in Kamchatka.
* [DHHack](https://dhhack.ru) - November 2019. Our team won in nomination **"Best research solution"**
* Recently, due to COVID-19 there were no real hackathons, but I really want to have one
