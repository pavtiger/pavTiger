### Hello there, I am Paul Artushkov (also known as pavTiger)

Since the earl childhood, I've been interested in technology. I started with soldering some boards and Arduino components. Then I slowly switched to Robotics olympiads with LEGO EV3. And went to RRO (Russian Robot Olympiad) in Innopolis. As I went to the fith grade, I switched to more practical programming (that was the time when I started using GitHub). And currently I am an Olympiad coder.
