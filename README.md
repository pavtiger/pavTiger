<h2> <I>Greetings, programs!</I> <img src="clu.jpg" alt="clu_emoji" width="38" height="35"/> <br> I am Paul Artushkov (also known as pavTiger) </h2>

ML, DevOps and Infrastructure Engineer, and a Software developer. Currently, I'm a student at the [Central University](https://centraluniversity.ru/) specializing in the Faculty of AI.

Languages I know well: **Python, C++, Javascript, C, Bash**  
I have strong expertise with **Linux**, **git**, **Docker**, **NGINX**, **TrueNAS**, **Proxmox** and **server hardware**, along with versatile device like **Raspberry Pi**. I run a homelab where I explore new technologies and use it as a powerhouse for my ML projects.

And a lot of coding experience: backends, data analytics, algorithms, web applications, scripts, parsers, and much more.
Considerable familiarity with **pytorch** and **pytorch3d** libraries, CV (**opencv**, **pytesseract** and CV neural networks) as well as [Three.js](https://github.com/physarumAdv/Physarum_Three.js) library for complex interfaces in Javascript.
#### Work experience
* [Renaissance Capital](https://www.rencap.com) - **Analyst**, where I worked with complex **Power BI workflows**, including advanced **Power Query** usage.
* [Telepat](https://telepat.online/medsenger.html) - **DevOps** and system administrator. I containerized their main backend with **Docker** and deployed services on-premises.
* [Visyond](https://visyond.com) - **Backend developer**, contributing to building and maintaining their core systems.

#### As much as working on projects I like attending science conferences:
* Won the **Advanced Research Award** at the International Korean Conference [KSASF](https://www.ksa.hs.kr/Eng/Home/Sub?menuId=42)
* Won the **Main Science Category Prize** at [Balt Konkurs](https://baltkonkurs.ru), one of the largest science conferences in my country

#### Hacks and olympiads:
* Winner of the [Data analysis National olympiad (DANO) 2022](https://dano.hse.ru/)
* Secured the top position in a data hackathon organised by Central University - July 2024
* [DHHack](https://dhhack.ru) - November 2019. Our team won in nomination **"Best research solution"**
* [HSE Gamedev](https://cs.hse.ru/se/2023/) - July 2023. We developed a game inspired by _Outer Wilds_ using **Unreal Engine** in under two weeks, **winning our category**


Outside of development, I enjoy creative pursuits like **broadcasting**, **sound mixing**, **photography**, and flying **FPV drones**.
