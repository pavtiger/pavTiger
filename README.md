## Hello there :suspect:, I am Paul Artushkov (also known as pavTiger)
Since early childhood, I've been interested in technology. I started with soldering some boards and Arduino components. 
Then I slowly switched to Robotics olympiads with LEGO EV3 system. And went to RRO (Russian Robot Olympiad) in **Innopolis**. 
As I went to the fifth grade, I switched to more practical programming (that was the time when I started using **GitHub**). 
Enjoy hackathons very much and have been to many of **CROC** ones (and won a few). Recently, I started doing competitive programming while studying in **Tinkoff Generation**.

I study in an IT & Math school named **Silaeder**, which is targeted to science projects.

Languages I know well: **Python, C++, Javascript, C**  
I have a lot of experience with Linux and bash scripting. 
Having tried a big variety of graphic libraries and frameworks, I've found Three.js, which is used in many of my projects.  
I enjoy [animation & 3D modeling](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcn5eK1LvnGsmkTJKvAw54Up8n7LRRUP_) as well. Here's some of my work.
* A favourite model of mine [TRON lightcycle](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tron-legacy-encom-786-lightcycle-89c2eba426574f53aaa9a8ee37c60495)
* [Jedi interceptor Star Wars animation](https://youtu.be/P4HUq_jLq50)

English level B2 proven by Cambridge exam PET (Currently my level is ~C1, but I didn't take the exam yet due to COVID). Once went to an English camp to Hastings, England to improve my English level.

As much as doing projects I like going to science conferences. I've participated in [Balt Konkurs](https://baltkonkurs.ru) in Saint Petersburg twice, winning 3rd-degree award and Youth jury laureate prize in Computer Science.
Also, won Advanced Research Award in an **International** Korean conference [KSASF](https://www.ksa.hs.kr/Eng/Home/Sub?menuId=42)

### Internships
I've been on an internship at a company named [Visyond](https://visyond.com).
They are creating an Excel for business people. It was a great experienceâ˜º  
Now I'm an intern in a company [Renaissance Capital](https://www.rencap.com), there I work with Power BI, especially Power Query which is an Excel add-on that is a tool to manage your data and do some other programming tasks.

### My favorite hackathons:
* [MediaHack](http://mediahack.me) - May 2019. Won the nomination **"Hellish coders"** because we wrote a tonn of code with great architecture and the organisers apparently really liked the way we were coding
* [CraftHack](https://crafthack.me) - August 2019. Had a fun time soldering Arduinos and trying to make a terminal game
* [WildHack](https://wildhack.croc.ru) - December 2021. First big hackathon since COVID started. Got together with some friends and wrote a Neural Network recognising fish in photos from a reserve park in Kamchatka.
* [DHHack](https://dhhack.ru) - November 2019. Our team won in nomination **"Best research solution"**  
Here are all the [sources](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y5jziR-H5-SE5bgzEbWFj7at5dIC8yY6?usp=sharing) (presentations, etc) for these hackathons.

Other than all that technical stuff, I also really enjoy listening to music (love soundtracks, classic music, EDM and some rap), flying FPV drones and working with cameras.
