## Hello there :suspect:, I am Paul Artushkov (also known as pavTiger)
Since early childhood, I've been interested in technology. I started with soldering some boards and Arduino components. 
Then I slowly switched to Robotics olympiads with LEGO EV3 system. And went to RRO (Russian Robot Olympiad) in <b>Innopolis</b>. 
As I went to the fifth grade, I switched to more practical programming (that was the time when I started using <b>GitHub</b>). 
Enjoy hackathons very much and have been to many of <b>CROC<b> hacks (and won a few). Recently, I started coding Olympiad tasks in <b>Tinkoff Generation<b>.

I study in an IT & Physics school named Silaeder, where we do many projects and hackathons.

Good-known languages: Python, C++, Javascript, Pascal
English level B2 proven by Cambridge exam PET (Currently my level is ~C1, but I didn't take the exam yet)

## My biggest projects are:
* [Physarum modeling](https://github.com/physarumAdv)
* [TRON Legacy game](https://github.com/light-merch/TRON_multiplayer)
* [Moscow Metro analytics](https://github.com/pavtiger/Moscow-Underground-Analysus)
* Chatbots
* And many more hackathons

Just before COVID-19, I went to Saint Petersburg to participate in [Balt Konkurs](https://baltkonkurs.ru). Won 3rd-degree award and Youth jury laureate prize in "Computer Science'.
Recently I went on an Internship at a company named Visyond.
They are doing an excel for business people. It was a great experience☺️


## My favorite hackathons:
* [MediaHack](http://mediahack.me) - May 2019. We won the nomination of "Hellish coders". Because we wrote a lot of code and had great architecture but al the final moments everything crashed.
* [CraftHack](https://crafthack.me) - August 2019. Had a fun time soldering Arduinos and trying to make a game in terminal
* [DHHack](https://dhhack.ru) - November 2019. Our team won in nomination "Best research solution".
* Recently, due to COVID-19 there were no real hackathons, but I really want to have one.
